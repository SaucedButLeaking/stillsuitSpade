# stillsuitSpade
Spading script for the PBBG Kingdom of Loathing's stillsuit item

Directions for use:

1) clone this repo into your kolmafia's scripts folder

2) In mafia, go to General > Preferences > Automation > Post-Adventure, and enter scripts/stillsuitSpade/stillsuitSpade.ash

3) At the end of the day, ask in #iotm on the ASS discord what to do with your data. (TODO: better answer for "what to do with the data") Data is saved to kolmafia's data directory and is named stillsuitSpade-YYYY-mm-dd.txt

Thanks to Beldur, Katarn, Damian Domino Davis, and the rest of the ASS discord for the assists and straight-up improvements.
